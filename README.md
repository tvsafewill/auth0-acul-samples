# Universal Login boilerplate App

This is a boilerplate application to help you getting started with building a customized login screen for Auth0 login using React, TypeScript, and Vite.
Universal Login offers a streamlined experience for users and does not require the use of JavaScript for customization.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1. An Auth0 staging or development tenant with an active [custom domain](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/custom-domains).
2. Configure the auth0 tenant to use the [Identifier First Authentication Profile](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/identifier-first).
3. A [React quickstart](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/tree/master/Sample-01) application configured to run with your custom domain.
4. Configure [Application metadata](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/application-settings) to run quickstart.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```typescript
//Update SDK dependecy in package.json to local ACUL JS SDK path
"devDependencies": {
     ...
     "@auth0/auth0-acul-js": "*",
  }
```

```
npm install
```

### 3. Build the Application

```sh
npm run build
```

### 4. Serve the Application

After building the application, you can serve it locally using `http-server`:

```sh
npx http-server dist -p <port>
```

This will start a local server on port 3032. You can access the application by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:3032` in your web browser.

### 5. Test the Application with sample quickstart

Go to your quickstart applicaiton and Login.

## How the Login Works

### Creating and Appending the Root Element

In the `src/main.tsx` file, we create a `div` element and append it to the `body` of the document. This is necessary for the Universal Login to work correctly. Here is the relevant code:

```tsx
const rootElement = document.createElement("div");
rootElement.id = "root";

document.body.appendChild(rootElement);
document.body.style.overflow = "hidden";
```

### Initializing Screen Objects LoginId, LoginPassword ...

In the src/screens/LoginId/index.tsx file, we initialize an object for the LoginId screen. This allows us to manage the state and behavior specific to this screen.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import LoginIdInstance from "ul-javascript";

const LoginIdScreen: React.FC = () => {
  const [loginIdManager] = useState(() => new LoginIdInstance()); //lazy initialization

  const handleLogin = () => {
    //Logic for continue
    loginIdManager.login({username:"", captcha: ""})
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render the login ID screen content */}
      <button onclick={handleLogin}>Continue<button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LoginIdScreen;
```

## Additional Information

- This project uses Vite for fast development and build processes.
- ESLint is configured to enforce code quality and consistency.
- SCSS is used for styling, with a focus on modular and reusable styles.
